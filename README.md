we can also create react project by

npx create-react-app '01basicproject'

here npx = node program executor
    create-react-app = utility

problem - it is very bulky utility 
    bhot saari chize hoti hai jo hume chaiye hi nhi isley bhot bada bundle size milta hai aur packages ka size bhi bhot bda hota hai

thats why recommended 
similarl utility  vite and parcel


to read a react project 
package.json 
there you will find name , version , dependencies

scripts hi project chlati hai ya phir production ke liye ready krti hai
